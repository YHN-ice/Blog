## Teaching
### TA at _Intro to Distributed System_ 
February -- June 2023
: Teaching Assistant, an introduction to distributed system for undergraduates 
: Software School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China
- Crafted monthly assignments and developed instructional code samples in a formal, technical, and comprehensible manner, covering topics including HDFS, HBase, Raft, and other distributed systems

### TA at _Programming in C for Freshmen_
: September 2022 -- January 2023
: Teaching Assistant, a C programming language introduction course 
: Software School, Fudan University, Shanghai, China 
- Assisted in debugging students' code for weekly assignments and the final project, and conducted project interviews in a class of 42 students, in collaboration with another TA
- Authored readable and well-structured formal tutorials in LaTeX, along with stub code for weekly assignments, to test students' familiarity with the C programming language
- Collaboratively designed the midterm and final projects with other assistants, which included detailed instructions for freshman students. The projects required developing the best strategy using Genetic Algorithms for a 2D game, as described in _Melanie Mitchell_'s book _Complexity: A Guided Tour_
